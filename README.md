This is a temporary ReadMe that I will actually create once this project is closer to finished.

This is a rewrite of a bot I created last year. The original one worked but the code was terrible and inefficient. You can find the original [Here](https://github.com/TalmageTalmage/elobot).

If you want to see a solid example of why this needed to be rewritten, you should check out the draft commands of the [original](https://github.com/TalmageTalmage/elobot/blob/main/commands/draft.js) compared to the [rewrite](https://github.com/TalmageTalmage/elobot2/blob/main/commands/Bot/draft.js).


This bot will help to create inhouse matchmaking for you and your friends. It tracks ELO, Wins, Losses, Head2Head stats for each individual game.
