This is a temporary ReadMe that I will actually create once this project is closer to finished.

This is a rewrite of a bot I created last year. The original one worked but the code was terrible and inefficient.


This bot will help to create inhouse matchmaking for you and your friends. It tracks ELO, Wins, Losses, Head2Head stats for each individual game.
